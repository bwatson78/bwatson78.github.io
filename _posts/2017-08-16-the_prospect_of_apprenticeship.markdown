**Expecting A Different Apprentice?**

My job search is maybe a month and a half old, and I've seen some traction. I've had a few phone interviews that focused on personality, about four coding challenges, one nerve-wracking technical interview, and a big "maybe" that remains a dangling thread. Recently, I've come across the prospect of apprenticeship, which reminded me of the first Job Report that Learn.co published as I was plodding away in their course. I saw a lot of graduates get full-time permanent positions, others signed onto internships, while another pool took on apprenticeships. 

I smiled when I saw that word. Apprenticeship. You have to know me a little bit to understand why I grinned at the mention of the word. I have been, for some twenty years, a loner but not by choice. I gravitated to fields of study and work that my direct and extended family could not relate to. I showed interest in computers to a mother that typed only on electric typewriters and a father that remains phobic of PCs to this day. I have been a rudderless ship for quite some time.

I have also suffered from being completely unaware of quite a common term: mentor. Mentors don't exist to somone so accustomed to bulldozing an unknown path. Fresh out of high school and dreaming of becoming a film director, I had read stories of how some directors making a name for themselves by being a one-man band, but most new directors are mentored by a fatherly figure in the business already. I found a lot of warm fuzzies in those stories, but the concept was alien to me. My extended family has not seen a ton of success.

Let's fast-forward to the now, and I've applied to an apprenticeship in Atlanta. The first thing they ask applicants to do is to read an ebook and reflect on it--*Apprenticeship Patterns* by David H. Hoover and Adewale Oshineye. The book's purpose is to prepare a green developer like me with the patterns that will be most effective in my maturation during an apprenticeship. A couple of chapters in and I'm hoping that this will be my first step out of school. 

More to come...
