Let me start off by saying that I now understand the technology sector's culture. It makes complete sense that companies that rely on ever changing standards and code languages expect their employees to geek out on the new and upcoming. I get that NOW. I didn't get it when I broached working in the technology field. I'm a son of a carpenter and a secretary/stay-home-mom, and a career to them was a clock-in, clock-out, nose-to-the-grindstone, keep-the-boss-happy monotony. My father, to this day, doesn't understand any of the jobs I've held that revolve around tech--that's incredibly frustrating.

Being the son of that man, whose sole advice to me for the workplace was "work hard and good things will come to you," created a frustrating reality for me right into the last semester of my Computer Information Technology Associate's Degree. That's when I was required to take a class centering on personal branding, and in that class, the concept of meetups was discussed. The problem was that class (and all further research on meetups) doesn't come out and say why meetups are essentially required for new programmers.

Meetups are about two things: assessing your social comfort and peacocking.

The first is simple: Potential employers want to know if you can hang. Can you be a positive addition to the overall mood of a fast-paced, collaborative push to the end result without creating a mutiny? During breaks, are you the type that makes your co-workers laugh or makes them uncomfortable? Are you going to be that silent, brooding guy in the corner or the dude cracking jokes around the coffee table? I got one main piece of advice from a guy that got a job by going to just one meetup: He covered the basics like "be kind, nice, and friendly," but he also heavily iterated, "don't bring up you're looking for a job unless the person you're talking to offers one." To me, that one bit spoke volumes. It made clear why meetups are valuable (besides peacocking.) Interviews are uncomfortable and awkward. Both the prospect and the prospective employer may have never met before. That employer has to size you up within the allotted time they have with you. If they're with a large corporation, they have to ask very uncomfortable interview questions and document the response. What if they met you beforehand and already liked you? Meetups.

What is peacocking? In a club, it's what that person that wore the brightest, most shocking clothes and makeup that makes their face glow, and is shouting the loudest.

This is peacocking:

But, in the technological field, it's lectures and hackathons. I just visited my first meetup a week ago and I had another kind person make it abundantly clear to me what's expected at meetups: sharing what you know. He pointed to a woman that was having a different conversation and mentioned that she watched from the sidelines for a while, researched the previous meetup's topics and found a hole in the topics that hadn't been discussed. She grabbed onto that concept, researched it, practiced it, and volunteered to present a couple of weeks later. In other words, prospective employers saw her take her training wheels off, explored a concept above her level and taught it to the rest of the group. That is exactly what employers want. Hackathons are nothing but sharing ideas and seeing concepts you've never heard of.

Confession time: Meetups and Hackathons intimidate me. I feel like a green programmer, and I don't want a group of my peers seeing just how badly I suck.

Crushing Reality: That's what Meetups and Hackathons are there for--it's a wakeup call. They remind you that you're a *Junior* Web Developer, and to play with the Seniors, you need to *stay* intellectually hungry.

I've been through a couple of interviews, and one Senior Developer performing the interview reminded me after I knew I wasn't up to par for the job that the industry is short over *1 million* Web Developers. It was kinda his way of saying, "You'll get a job, don't worry. Just not this job." I'm reminded of a different line of work that also has shortages in the millions: Nursing. Because my wife is a Nurse, I know why there are shortages. The job is unpleasant, requires a ton of sacrifice, is so constantly demanding that Nurses get heaped upon them constant appreciation in numerous forms, but I guarantee you that Nurses never feel appreciated enough. There are some parallels between the two careers, but, to me, Web Developing looks much more pleasant. 

Why are there shortages in Web Development? Software Engineering is not a "punch-the-clock" type of job, and I think the masses left unemployed because their trade has gone by the wasteside can see that. The industry relies on truly dynamic individuals that constantly improve themselves. That makes it inherently daunting to previous generations. My guess is that new generations will eagerly fill the million-plus gap. But for guys like me, I have to--and *have* adapted.
