As I was going through bootcamp--hell, even my previous Associate's Degree work--I always envied the way that certain instructors flew through demonstrations with hotkeys and macros. Whenever I could, I'd always ask what they just did that would take me many minutes to accomplish. The problem with picking up tips that way is that it's on the fly. I'm a part of a lecture and I don't want to throw off the instructor's rhythm. I also want to pay full attention, though, so it becomes a mental note that I often forget. 

That's why I love sites that offer "kung-fu." One day, I wondered if others thought like me and referred to time saving and application expanding tips as kung-fu. One google search later and the answer is "yes." I found these:

[Ruby On Rails 365](http://www.rubyonrails365.com/)

[React Kung Fu](http://reactkungfu.com/)

[Rails Refactoring Podcast](http://rails-refactoring.com/podcast/)

And after some searching, I found GitBooks, but more specifically, that fellow programmers are spilling their skill beans when it comes to their profession.

[Ruby Fu](https://rubyfu.net/content/en/)

This is all very weird for me. The professions I've worked in have been very, um, "elitist," for lack of a better word. The skills they had were very simple and clear to convey, but were not at all eager to share because they paid (a lot) in school to get them. Skills like how to properly set up a HD camera to focus correctly were paid for by embarrassment and ridicule. Any wonder why I got out of that business?
