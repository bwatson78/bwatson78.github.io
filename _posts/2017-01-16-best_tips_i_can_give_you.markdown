1. Get used to failure. Errors are common and the only way to avoid them is to form a habit of building something methodically the right way.
2. Don't get angry at yourself. If you do, just walk away from it--clear your head, take a walk, shower up, watch "Sneaky Pete" on Amazon (good show), or leave it for the next day.
3. During your down time, you will think about programming, but more specifically: how a method or Gem works, or how to fix something you have no idea why it's not working. This is normal...and a good thing. It shows that you like to fix problems. That makes you a good person.
4. If you're stuck in a hornet's nest of errors you don't know how to get out? Ask for help or throw the project folder in the trash, refork, and start over. Ask for help if you have an inkling of what the problem could be, because the helper will need that. If you have no clue what the problem could be? Start over. Work each error slowly. Get familiar with how to fix errors based on how they're worded.
5. Don't make it pretty until you have to. Do the least amount of work until you have a website-creating machine functioning properly. Then worry about divs, classes, css, partials, helpers, etc.
6. Start putting the tools you're learning to practice on your own material. Spare the time. Skip an episode or two of that reality show you keep watching. Build your portfolio now and perfect it later.
