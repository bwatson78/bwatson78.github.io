By completing the final lesson of Sinatra elements, I feel almost capable of writing all the code needed to make a website. The reality, though, is that I'm only halfway through. It is actually leaving me scratching my head, wondering what other tools are 100% required. Once again, kudos to this school for providing me with in-depth experience on what a programmer has to do day in, day out. I didn't get notion one when I attended a State College here in Florida. Courses where you can get your hands dirty constantly will always be my preference from now on.

Halfway through, I now know the structure of a website's file system by heart. Sure, I learned how to write a general html page out of college. But when I looked at sites like Facebook, I knew there were tons more going on behind the scenes. What I've reached today is the first ton--which is that websites are built upon powerful databases that can be accessed and queried pretty easily with the right tools. Still, the wonderful thing about Ruby is that it will tell you upfront where things broke, and with its direction, familiarize the programmer with the proper syntax when new tools are introduced. 

So, at this point, what can I do? I can write a website that can be released in the wild. It can create new users and retain their data. It can process that data in endless ways. It can even grab data from a different website or published data documents and use it automatically, with very little maintenance from the programmer. The fact that I'm only halfway through is enlightening. The tools I have now can build a rudimentary Twitter or Facebook. What lies ahead is very exciting.
