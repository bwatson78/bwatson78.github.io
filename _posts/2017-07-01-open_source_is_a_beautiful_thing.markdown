When I completed my Learn.co Full Stack course with React/Redux, I had a strong inclination that I came very close to building an iOS application. React spits out a fully functional webpage with routes that takes you to different functionality and it only loads the root html path. If you build a React application, once up and running, the feel of it is very "iOS"-like. I had heard that the next step from building a JS reliant webpage to a fully functional Apple phone app was a small one from many instructors at Learn. Doing a quick google search for "React kung fu" has confirmed it.

I've happened upon a very useful blog, and in the name of Open Source, I will share it here: [React Kung-Fu](reactkungfu.com). What this blog entry proves is that a simple iOS application can be built by downloading a couple of hombrew apps and and writing the code completely in React. Oh,...and doing this all on a Mac (sorry Linux and Windows coders). 

I've just kicked off my job search and have felt confidence dip a bit. I live in Orlando and the largest employers in the area are huge multinational companies. They also happen to own the big multimedia outlets that I'd love to work for. In other words, they make movies, and I'm a huge movie nerd. Combining their content with my newly learned skill would be a true chocolate/peanut butter marriage moment. But since they are large corporate entities, they have built their backends on .NET, which I completely understand. "Open Source" is still a phrase that carries with it an ugly stigma to large companies. (Side Note: This stigma has been a strange one for large companies to hold onto. Microsoft, itself, has started to use and incorporate Open Source Linux into their everyday operations.)

All that means is that I will have to crack open a .NET book sometime soon--no biggie. My point is that I understand why Learn.co taught me Ruby on Rails instead. There is great value in learning the shortest route of producing a workable product. It is often the simplest and most effective. Ruby is, for the most part, hardware agnostic. Sure, some hacking is required to run it on Windows, but you can still get it working--and, besides, dual-booting OS' is a wonderful thing. 

Ultimately, though, if I can write code using (mostly) non-proprietary elements and produce an app that can immediately work on the most used platforms today, my allegiance will definitely fall with that side.

Oh, and for a workaround with the proprietary element (Mac computer) that React Native requires, stay tuned for my Hackintosh blog entry.
