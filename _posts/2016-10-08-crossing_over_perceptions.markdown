To those just starting out at Flatiron, or programming in general, I can tell you that the hardest hurdle to leap when creating webpages or programs instead of just using them is perception. As a matter of fact, with each level of understanding anything in life, perception is always the downfall. Perception is ultimately tied into ignorance--or because you don't know how something works, it exists in the realm of "magic". 

To those born in or before the thirties, TV was probably magic. Forty year olds or those near that age fear that robots or artificial intelligence will take over humans. Nowadays, everyone in this country fears terrorism. The reason for all of these perceptions is ignorance. My perception concerning computer programs and dynamic websites was that they were millions of lines of code and that only geniuses and scientists knew how to write and read those cryptic lines. As I'm learning more and more about programming and coding, the truth comes out: I am purely learning a language that thousands before me have created words for, and all I'm really doing is expressing my ideas through that language. As I go, I might get creative enough to make my own "word", but at the moment, I'm just learning how to write a "short story", if you catch my meaning.

Full disclosure: I already have an Associates in Computer Information Technology and have taken programming classes before. With the program I studied in, if I had changed around a couple of courses, I would have been ready for a career in programming. I can assure you that I, as well as most others who graduated with me, was not. An Associates Degree, when I attended, didn't require a real understanding of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). As a matter of fact, my professor, who had been a programmer before teaching, painted OOP as this Rubiks Cube and Procedural or Linear Programming as Chutes and Ladders. We brushed on it lightly and, strangely enough, Objective C++ wasn't a requirement to obtain the focus in programming. But I believe that it should be taught first.

Because here is my new perception of programming: you and I are just building a program consisting of many tiny programs that have all been built with many other programs that all have published and official names. And this is really good news! This means most of those many million lines of code that your program will consist of will be automatically written for you when you write your commands. I am currently writing code for a bare-bones version of Twitter as a class project. I can attest that I have written more words for a "What I Did This Summer" essay then I have for this website.

Essentially, programming is talking in "Bro Speak":

```
Yo, Dude. Wanna go to a bar?
How much for cover?
$15.00
Band Playing?
No, but it's Ladies' Night.
I'm in.
```

If you have never coded a day in your life and wondering what it consists of, that block above is pretty damn close.
