	So, I have completed my first GEM using Ruby, and I can let you know of a few of my opinions. The first is: Scraping is challenging. I'll go into more detail below, but getting things to work like a dream with the CSS pointers isn't a walk in the park. The second opinion: GEM's are quite flexible and fun. The last comment is that Ruby does really try to help you along. 

	Scraping has been hard for me since the first lesson. I can basically sum up my issues with Scraping with my troubles getting pry to work consistently. I've come across some weird responses with pry about half of the time--responses that have left learn.co instructors scratching their heads. But recently, it has been consistent (no doubt, due to upgrades with the IDE) and I have had days of practice trying to get Nokogiri to point to the right material. I guess that's the point. Tools like Nokogiri operate off of their own syntax, and we have to learn that syntax just like all other programming language traits to become proficient at this work. My advice working with Nokogiri? Be as persistent as a bulldog and don't be afraid to search the web to find the solution. I also ran into the issue of trying to pull details from a page that uses JavaScript to alter its content. If you try to pull data down from a website offering a pull down menu that alters what choices you see, run away! I eventually had to pull my data from the podcast's XML feed. 

	The very idea of GEM's is quite refreshing. It really lends a new programmer like myself a treasure trove of working code that can be picked apart and reverse engineered and applied to my own projects. The fact that these gems are published to a public website with all of the programs' guts bare is incredibly useful. I will say this: reading other persons' code is incredibly confusing. When I find that a lot of code is written on lines that have no more than ten characters written, I often feel a lack of description of what the code does.

	Now, the beauty of Ruby. My first programming language was C++. It's a great language and I would go back to it again, but the compiler environment left much to speculate whenever things didn't work. Forgoing the compiler with Ruby and the fact that Ruby points to where things are breaking so clearly is a Godsend. When I was first starting out with C++, I always left a day before due date to debug, because the simplest of problems was hard to find. With Ruby, I can debug on the fly. And kudos to Flatiron for taking the fear out of understanding Object Orientation. The way that most text books are written, OO is akin to a very powerful weapon that can be catastrophic in the wrong hands. Really, it's just a box of tools that are interchangeable across different projects.

	GEM's are no sweat. They're just a way to package that program you have lying around and share it. They're also incredible useful programs we use daily to learn programming.
