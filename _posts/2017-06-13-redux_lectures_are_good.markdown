About a month ago, just starting out in React, I surfed over to Amazon to buy who-knows-what and just started staring at the layout. I'm guessing it's built with React, and I'm pondering the many hours it took just to build that front page. There must be literally hundreds of components right there. It was then that I realized what Jr. Web Developers most likely spent the majority of their time on: creating one small corner of a page and ensuring it talks to the given state. 

That was a month ago.

I now feel like I can crank out a ton of components without a sweat. Connecting them all through Redux is the 800 lb. gorilla in the room. Unfortunately, the written Learn.co lessons don't do the best job of explaining how it works. It, admittedly, is not the easiest task. The easiest way to understand how to put a store together is to watch somebody perform the task step-by-step that knows enough to point out the results of each implementation. Which means I heavily recommend Learn.co students venture over to their Learn.co slack page, click on the online-web-developer page and track down the link for lectures. Filter by Redux and devote some time to watching them.

Oh, and anytime an instructor recommends a tool that lets you peek behind the scenes, download it. [Redux Webtools](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjE6KjHurvUAhXFbiYKHQF5AIMQFggqMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fchrome.google.com%2Fwebstore%2Fdetail%2Fredux-devtools%2Flmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd%3Fhl%3Den&usg=AFQjCNFg4ldS78uapjCGBaNjL9NvIwZGhg&sig2=WI30jDQOBAIl1pBfoaGDYw) is absolutely essential in figuring out if things are working and what your current state looks like.

Just a little nugget of truth that Avi passed along in one of his lectures: try to figure out an answer to a problem for a good long time before giving up and asking for help. Notice I said nothing about searching for the solution online. You need to search online for the answer! Seven times out of ten, I will not find the direct answer to my question when I search by the error. It will just lead me on a breadcrumb trail to the POSSIBLE cause, not the answer. What that does is help me to associate an issue to the underlying fault. 

Pain is your friend. Does it help to obsessively seek an answer to a problem that plagues your software? An absolute Yes! It's training wheels to the next level of expertise.
