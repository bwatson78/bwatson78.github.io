After an unexpected departure from my last developing position, I'm dropped back into the job search game. It's amazing how not much changes after a year. It seems that the same companies are looking for Full-Stack Web Dev's as were a year ago. Ruby on Rails growth in Orlando seems stagnant. What am I seeing?

ASP.NET

That group looks mighty familiar.

I'm taking the hint. It's time to become a Frameworks Swiss Army knife. On the frontend, I feel that React sits on solid ground (Ember, Angular, and Vue look *really* smiliar.)
