A couple of weeks ago, Learn dropped some video reviews into my que along with the React tier. I wasn't, initially, a happy camper. But I am now, after watching them. Here's why:

I forgot some connective tissue on what certain shortcuts do.

And that is not a good thing, Martha. Also, I heard some sage advice: "Slow down." And yes, that is great advice because, like most, I retain information very slowly and repetitively. Yet, there is another reason to slow down. I flew through javascript. The lessons detail very well what it's used for in most in Rails Applications and how to write it. So, imagine my surprise when I open up the JQuery Tic Tac Toe and felt completely lost. 

What I'm pointing out, really, is the confidence gut punch that comes when you don't really practice something. I can watch baseball on television, buy a bat, mimic the moves a batter makes, and spend an afternoon in batting practice where I will probably get very confident that I can play in my community league. But once I do tryout, with that one afternoon of practice, I will most likely win the positon of benchwarmer.

*Just like these dudes.*

This is not the first time I've hit a wall. I believe the lessons are designed to make you feel confident until you reach the project phase, and then all of a sudden, you're hitting nothing but dust. So...practice makes confidence.
