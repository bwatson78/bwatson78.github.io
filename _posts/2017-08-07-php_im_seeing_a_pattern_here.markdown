When I interviewed last, and I was told that PHP was one of the holes in my resume, I asked if he felt that PHP was a steep learning curve to someone familiar with my toolset (Ruby on Rails, JS, jQuery, React, and Redux.) He didn't think so, but he did doubt that I could get to the professional level in time. I didn't leave the interview despondent--I'm not a professional in the strictest of terms, anyway. I'm, technically, the greenest web developer there is, having just completed a coding bootcamp with zero professional experience in the field.

The school I went through offers a money-back guarantee, but it has restrictions, and those restrictions are very telling of what's required to land a job. I must blog once (Hello!), commit via Git five times, and make eight personal connections (email, meetup, or phone conversation) each week for the next six months. If you dissect those requirements, it's easy to see how much work should go into proving one's worth. To me, I've come to understand that the Git commits are the most important. It translates like this:

"Good job, kid. Your school gave you training wheels and taught you the basic structure. Now, I want to see if you can actually produce a website I'd enjoy visiting daily."

Which brings me to why I'm jumping feet first into PHP, and eventually WordPress (I thought it was just for blogs.) I have waded through the syntax of PHP, and...I'm in familiar territory here. Thankfully, when software engineers build new languages, they don't wipe the slate clean and ignore the common structures that most are used to. It reads like Javascript, and can write it within minutes of learning the ground rules. The hardest things I've had to learn is the tag structure and the "GET/POST" procedures. 

Confession time: half of me feels I'm neglecting the other core languages I've studied on. Somehow, I'm doing a disservice to myself by not practicing the linear structures I've built up. But, the other half has seen the countless positions for Junior Developers revolving around WordPress and PHP while the few Ruby or React based positions come and go and scream for experienced coders. I can assure you, this is not panic from my side, rather a rationalization that I'm seeing the community openly talking about their workplace jumping the Ruby ship and seeking refuge in WordPress. Disney, one of the largest companies, uses WordPress. 

I'm just correcting my own ship.
