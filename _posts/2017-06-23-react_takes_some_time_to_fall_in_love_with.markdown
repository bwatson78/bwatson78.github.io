When I program, I'm accustomed to having the outline of the project front and center. Ruby on Rails is a beautiful thing because the outline for the presentation side takes five minutes to learn. The views, if you let them be, are rigid and predictable, and everything starts with ```index```. Throwing jQuery into the mix still maintains the Rails structure, and the website ends up being Ruby with JavaScript injected. React takes modularity into the extreme--but modularity ends up being it's most beautiful trait.

Just starting on React, I couldn't believe how much time I spent on the smallest bit of webspace real estate. I couldn't believe that I was programming so long so that the end user didn't have to see a page refresh. Of course, this is the wrong thinking, on many accounts. I, as a student, am seeing quick page refreshes as a non-issue since I'm dealing with miniscule pages I create myself. When dealing with a massive commerce sites that preloads a sizable chunk of state, that instant change I notice ends up resembling a typical page refresh when reaching out to, let's say, Newegg.com. The typical user, which I have been for quite a long time, doesn't realize that specialized code helps load an incredibly dense page so fast. They might think that the reason that Newegg loads so fast is that they have some exceptional pipeline to it's server--not that the information they're about to request is lying in wait for them. 

So why was I so hesitant to fully embrace modularity until I learned React? Because, in most situations, I can make a page work without it (when you don't factor in back-end filtering or data manipulation.) I know this is a weak argument. I'm alright with that. It's out in the open that programmers are lazy. New ones just want to make it work. Excellent programmers want to load a page like a Ferrari accelerates. That's hard to teach to a newbie. They just want the program not to err.

Modularity (especially in React) makes troubleshooting a breeze. With the React Developer Tools installed, you can see exactly what props are being passed. Throw in the Redux and you can constantly monitor the state. Any other problem will produce an error that will lead you directly to the answer. 

And the other beautiful thing about React? Programming for cell phone apps no longer seems like a mystery. React webpages function alot like any app on my iPhone.
