I've put my Blu-Ray Wishlist on Rails and I'm a happy camper. Why? Because I've created something that has a behind the scenes logic that is (or could be) graphically appealing. That's huge for me. The main problem I've always had with different languages is that, when you just scratch the surface, you can't see how that program translates to a graphical interface. Command line, sure. But unless you're rocking linux, it makes no sense.

Once again, kudos to how Flatiron exposes us to the basic building blocks of what Rails is. I can see the tissue of all the different GEM's everywhere. I've now programmed myself to love and respect them as the treasure trove of tools they truly are. 

What do I say to someone about to start this project? Google is your friend. It truly highlights how GEM's are your friends as well. The labs and lessons go only so far, and you will forget them and there will be one line dropped in those lessons that will fix a multitude of the errors you're seeing.
