I feel ready to make websites. 

After completing my portfolio project integrating Rails and Javascript, I now feel ready and excited to create websites. Of course, I will encounter multiple speed bumps along the way in the form of creative (or not) criticism, but I can actually say that the process is fun. The most important part is that the prospect of making this my career actually lifts weight off of my shoulders and puts me at ease. This is a good fit for me.

My impressions of incorporating Javascript into websites? It's easier than Rails. I view JS (Javascript) as a ninja--a nimble warrior that you'll never see do it's magic. The beautiful thing about the language is that it will not break your website, it will only enhance it. Hold on--let me correct myself. If you're website doesn't perform as intended, it's obviously broken. What I meant to say is that, if JS doesn't work, the chunks of code it delivers will not work. If Rails doesn't work, you can type in the domain and hit enter all you want, but you're getting back an error message.

Does this mean I like JS more than Rails? Absolutely not. Rails is that main V8 Hemi all car enthusiasts gush about. Javascript is the 5.1 surround system and leather seats inside the car.
