II live in Orlando, FL. If you haven't screamed "Disney" yet, then I'm sure you've lived in a forty year coma and haven't started consuming media since. I've been blessed to have gone through a few different interviews, all of different types. Unfortunately, all I've walked away with is practice and an understanding of my local tech scene. What I grasped was that Central Florida is trendy in all aspects, not just our ever changing theme parks. If you want to be a web developer, you have to be social enough to find out what languages and frameworks firms are jumping on at any given moment. That's how fast things move.

SInce I've started applying for jobs, I've gathered a small list of tools that the companies I've interviewed with considered "holes" in my resume. They're as follows: 

* JSON Web Token (JWT)
* Wordpress
* PHP

And the biggest deficit of them all?

* Experience

This last one is the one that hurts the most but is inevitable--you will learn that Development firms will reject you via email within a day because of having no professional experience. I will spare you the frustration this "Catch 22" produces. I will just give you two pieces of advice that have been passed along to me: accept contract work with open arms and perfect your portfolio projects. Indent properly, document each function and component, and make the finished website look professional and clean.

Why know your tech scene? Orlando is heavy on marketing firms that cater to local businesses. Local businesses want graphics-ladened, slick websites that grab the eye, and PHP/Wordpress is the latest set of tools that firms adopt to build those websites. Does that mean I sulk away, defeated, and move onto the next list of applications? No. These companies are five minutes away from my house--I’ll show them that I can jump on PHP’s train just as fast as they can.

But there's one bit of advice I left out: start learning the languages, tools, and frameworks that the places you've actually interviewed with call holes. Think about it. You got in the door and passed the credentials test. If they gave you a coding challenge or a technical interview, that most likely means you passed the personality test. The thing that tripped you up was your knowledge or your code. 

That just means you have more to learn and perfect.
