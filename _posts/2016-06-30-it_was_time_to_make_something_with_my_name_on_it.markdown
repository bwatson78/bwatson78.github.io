  I got sucked into Customer Service work, as most students without a clearly defined lifepath do. Also, my family had no money or the understanding of how to save for something big. So I went straight into flipping burgers. I have progressed in the field of customer service, but that's not an item of pride for me.
  
  You see, moving up in Customer Service just means you take on more of the blame and more of the stress. And even though I was eager to show off that exemplary work ethic I was ingrained with, I found that's a lose-lose. As the years went by dealing with customers over the phone and face to face, their issues were becoming less challenges to fix, and I was becoming more of the company's "whipping boy."
  
  I knew out of high school that I wanted to write--that it was something I enjoyed. Computer Science was something that intrigued me. I spent a full twenty-four hours figuring out how to run one DOS game on the first computer I ever touched. From that point on, it was my favorite "tool" to work with. I sponged up every trick, procedure, and abstract application I could find and became the "geek" in the family. But at that moment, the writing and creating I focused on were scripts and films. 
  
  My eyes were huge and my heart was hoping as I entered my first term at FSU. They had their brand new film school competing with NYU and USC and I was sure they would see that spark in me and scoop me up within an instant. They didn't. So I gave up being creative. Stopped being hopeful of some prolific career expressing myself. Needless to say, that didn't sit right with me. When you give up, all you're left with are regrets. 
  
  So, web development is the culmination of two realizations: I have to try what I thought I'd be killer at, and I speak computer. Ultimately, I'm looking for some notches in the "Win" column. I'm learning that I build a career using failures as stairs to the next level. The biggest realization, however, is that I've done my time in the Customer Service field, and it's time to move on.
